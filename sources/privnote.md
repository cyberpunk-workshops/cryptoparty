# How secure is Privnote?

Privnote is not very safe. In the USA people have been convicted because of Privnote evidence.

I didn't check the js. The server-side code isn't open source.

According to a competitor, through the ads on the page malicious code could be injected.

Privnotes have been used in the trial as evidence. Probably they aquired them via a vulnerability.

In the trial were also undercover agents involved. But the convicted Nazi Drug Dealer communicated with them via Cryptocat. So I think, the PrivNote messages were not aquired by being undercover, but by a vulnerability/court order/whatever. So it's probably insecure to use PrivNote.
